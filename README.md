# Minesweeper

Starter project to understand SwiftUI with MVVM architecture.

Try it out yourself! Here are the [rules](https://minesweepergame.com/strategy/how-to-play-minesweeper.php) if you are playing it first time.

Main outcome:
- MVVM arcchitecture and its ViewModel being the brain and bridge between the Model and View.
- @EnvironmentObject for the main ViewModel so that it can be used in every View of the app.

Side outcomes:
- You can learn how to use custom fonts and images.
- Simple NavigationView with custom toolbar.
